# Assignment-6
This repository is for tp2 assignment6 Domain Driven Design.

The file domaindrivendesignassignment6 constists of an example of domain driven design.
The file has both unit tests and instrumented unit tests, the reason for having instrumented
unit tests are to test the setup and communication with the database. The unit tests are
executed using a test suite named TestSuiteRunner.java, these tests are used to test the 
factory objects. Once the project is opened a rebuild is required, it seems, in order for
the test suite to operate.
